# Solidity Vault with ERC20 Token Interaction

Welcome to the Solidity Vault repository! This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named `Vault`, designed to serve as a secure vault for managing ERC20 token deposits and withdrawals. The `Vault` contract interacts with an ERC20 token contract to facilitate these operations efficiently and securely.

## Contracts

### Vault.sol

The `Vault` contract is the core component of this repository. It manages the deposit and withdrawal of ERC20 tokens and handles the calculations of shares for depositors. Additionally, it ensures the conversion of shares back to tokens for withdrawal purposes. The contract maintains essential state variables, tracks total supply, and manages individual balances of deposited tokens.

interface IERC20 {
    // Interface definition for ERC20 token functions
    ...
}

contract Vault {
    // State variables
    ...

    // Constructor
    ...

    // Internal functions
    ...

    // External functions
    ...
}
```

### ERC20.sol

The `ERC20` contract provided here represents a basic ERC20 token implementation. It includes essential functionalities such as transfer, approval, allowance, minting, and burning.

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract ERC20 {
    // State variables
    ...

    // Events
    ...

    // External functions
    ...
}
```

## Usage

To effectively utilize the `Vault` contract, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy the ERC20 Token Contract (`ERC20.sol`):** Begin by deploying the ERC20 token contract to the Ethereum blockchain. This contract represents the token that will be deposited and withdrawn from the `Vault`.

2. **Deploy the Vault Contract:** Deploy the `Vault` contract, ensuring to provide the address of the deployed ERC20 token contract to its constructor. This step establishes the connection between the `Vault` and the ERC20 token for seamless interaction.

3. **Interact with the Vault Contract:** Once deployed, interact with the `Vault` contract to deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens securely. Utilize the functions provided by the `Vault` contract to manage token deposits and withdrawals efficiently.
